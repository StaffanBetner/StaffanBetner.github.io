### Freelance

- Political Charts, SVT (2018)

I was hired by the Swedish Public Service television company (SVT) before the general election 2018 to do an analysis of their survey for their political quizzes. The assignment was in essence to describe the political landscape in a quantitative manner. All parties (and candidates to the Riksdag) was placed in common political spaces, depending on the administrative level. You can see the political charts for all administrative units at [valkompassen.svt.se](http://valkompassen.svt.se) (in Swedish).
